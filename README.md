## Description 
[Visit the Deployed Site](https://fa-notetaker.herokuapp.com/)

This application works to allow users to write, saved, and retrieve notes. 

The starter code for was provided, so no changes were made to the front-end. I used Express.js to build the back-end. Express.Router(), which was required in the index.js of the routes folder, allowed for get and post routes to be established. In the server.js, Express.js was used to create the HTML routes.

## Portfolio Example

While this application had the front-end HTML provided, I initially had difficulty creating the proper api routes on the back-end. I had referenced the use of "/api" in the index.js files on both the routes and api folders. This caused an error when my server would attempt to fetch "/api/notes" since the routes were actually set-up for "/api/api/notes". I resolved this issue by removing the "/api" reference from the index.js in the api folder.


This is the code from the index.js of the routes folder which creates "router.use('/api', apiRoutes);".

```
const router = require('express').Router();

const apiRoutes = require('./api');

router.use('/api', apiRoutes);

module.exports = router;

```

This is the code from the index.js of the api folder with "router.use('/api', apiRoutes);".

```
const router = require('express').Router();

const notesRouter = require('./notesRoutes');

router.use('/notes', notesRouter);

module.exports = router;

```

## Learning Points 

Working on this Note Taker application taught me a lot about how to properly write code for routes. Being diligent with which folders I create code in will ensure that routes are being fetched propely.
